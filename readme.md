# TODO

* Button to feed each pet
* Add limits to how hungry / happy a pet can be
	--> when a pet dies, remove the pet (splice pet out of the pets array within model)
* Be able to enter (somehow) how much food / fun we want to give a pet
	--> range and use value within each onclick event
* Clear out the name input field when we create a new pet
	--> within the button click event (perhaps move into view)
* Have the pets slowly get hungry / bored over time
	--> interval **

Also, anything you want to add!
